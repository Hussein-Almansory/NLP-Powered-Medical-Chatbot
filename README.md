# Medical Chatbot

## Introduction
Welcome to the Medical Chatbot project! This Python application leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Artificial Intelligence to provide accurate preliminary diagnoses based on user-input symptoms. The chatbot extracts information from medical PDFs and uses two advanced language models, ChatOpenAI and Flan-T5-SMALL, for effective communication.
